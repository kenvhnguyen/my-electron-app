// Many of Electron's core modules are Node.js event emitters that adhere to Node's asynchronous event-driven architecture. 
// The app module is one of these emitters.

// In Electron, BrowserWindows can only be created after the app module's ready event is fired. 
// You can wait for this event by using the app.whenReady() API and calling createWindow() once its promise is fulfilled.

// Note: You typically listen to Node.js events by using an emitter's .on function, like this:
/// app.on('ready', () => { createWindow() })
// However, Electron exposes app.whenReady() as a helper specifically for the ready event to avoid subtle pitfalls with directly listening to that event in particular. See electron/electron#21972 for details.
